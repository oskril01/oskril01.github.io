            This project investigates how neural network depth affects generalization by analyzing the geometry of the training-loss landscape. Fully connected networks of varying depths were trained on MNIST and analyzed using curvature and loss metrics at their converged minima. Two summary statistics—a parameter cluster radius and a depth-dependent trade-off weight—revealed an optimal window near depth 4. Adding a global curvature penalty reduced validation error by over 15%, showing that Hessian-based regularization can improve generalization in a principled, architecture-aware way.

      <h3>Entropy and Energy Measures: Complementary Tools for Analyzing Reaction-Diffusion Dynamics</h3>

            This project explores how two complementary metrics—Shannon entropy and the energy norm—can be used to characterize the behavior of reaction-diffusion systems. By solving a coupled system across a range of diffusivity and reactivity parameters, we generated solutions exhibiting diverse dynamic regimes. Entropy proved effective at identifying sharp transitions with minimal time data, while the energy norm captured fine-grained variations within evolving patterns. Together, these measures offer a powerful framework for understanding phase transitions and emergent behavior in spatially distributed systems.
